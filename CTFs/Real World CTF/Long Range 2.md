A zipped attachment is given with a windows executable `flash_dump.exe` and an audio file `486_375MHz-1MSps-1MHz.wav`.

I tried using DeepSound on the .wav file, however it didn't ask for a password and yielded no results.

Long Range 2 might have been a reference to the LoRa communication protocol; searching for challenges related to it pointed me to [this](https://tipi-hack.github.io/2019/05/12/esgi-19-lorawan.html) writeup. I tried installing `gr-lora` through both the manual install and Docker but it failed both times.
