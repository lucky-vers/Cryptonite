Unpacking the attachment reveals a directory named `tar.extracted`.

Inside it we find a zip file `Secret.zip` and a PCAP file.

I examined the pcap file using Wireshark, but couldn't find any relevant information. Upon attempting to extract the contents of `secret.zip`, a password prompt appeared, which I couldn't solve.
