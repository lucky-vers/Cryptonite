# OSINT -  Literally 1984

**Flag:** `csawctf{Susumu_Hirasawa}`

```
An artist by the name of ‌ made a cover of a song I liked, but I don't remember the original composer of that song. Could you help me find the original composer?
```

I first noticed the \u200c character in the description and searched all across the web for artists with that name. Eventually I remembered the artist `x0o0x` with an empty YouTube username who posted vocaloid songs without any title too.

I checked the Vocaloid wiki for all their songs, and which ones they made were covers. I eventually landed on their cover of "Big Brother" by Susumu Hirasawa. And sure enough, the flag was `csawctf{Susumu_Hirasawa}`

## OSINT - Mystery

```
Remember the composer from Literally 1984? Well, they made a song when they were part of a band in 1992, and it turns out that ‌ also made a cover of this song, collabing with another artist. What is the name of that artist?
```

**Flag:** `csawctf{Chogakusei}`

Similar to the challenge `Literally 1984`, I went through all the songs of `x0o0x` and found the correct collab to be their one with Chogakusei titled "LAB=01", giving the flag `csawctf{Chogakusei`.
