\textit{watch ads for a free flag, with amazing data integrity (patent not pending) URL: http://litctf.org:31785/} \\

We were given a website which incremented a variable by clicking a button. When the variable reached 10 $\wedge$ 18 we would get the flag. Inspecting the script running the site we found it ran WASM, which was the code we had to reverse to get the flag. \\

Things I learned in this challenge:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item{\textbf{WASM decompiling:} Using tools such as \texttt{wat2wasm} and \texttt{wasm2js} to decompile and convert WASM to more readable languages.}
    \item{\textbf{WASM reversing:} Understanding WASM syntax and logic.}
    \item{\textbf{Using the Ghidra WASM plugin:} Found this out after the CTF ended.}
\end{enumerate}

After looking at other writeups and on the Discord it turned out it performing the summation

\begin{center}
    $y = \displaystyle\sum_{x=0}^{10^{18}-1} (8x^3 + 3x^2 + 3x + 8)$
\end{center}

Putting the valu
