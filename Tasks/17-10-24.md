# TCP1P - Lost Progress

```
My friend Andi just crashed his computer and all the progress he made are gone. It was 2 of his secret passwords with each of them being inside an image and a text file. Luckily he has an automatic RAM capture program incase something like this happen, but no idea on how to use it...

Memdump challenge. I threw everything I had at it

- `filescan`, `netscan`, `pslist` analysis.
- dumping all files, then dumping by PIDs of programs like `code.exe` and `notepad.exe`.
- running the usual `strings`, `binwalk`, stego stuff on file dumps.
- running `strings` on the dump itself out of desperation.

I found a file `Temp\hmm.txt` and tried dumping it but to no avail. It was the last chal I tried before the CTF ended and I spent a good bit of time both in NLH and in my room trying to figure something out.

When the CTF ended, I found a writeup for it, containing something I entirely overlooked — dumping the contents of `gimp.exe` and opening it in Gimp. I had never even thought of that, since I've never seen Gimp used like this in a chal before.

**New thing I learned:**

1. More knowledge of volatility3 plugins generally
2. Greater situational knowledge of memory forensics — namely that when you see a `gimp.exe` being run, dump it.

Writeup (more of a short comment) of the chal I read: https://discord.com/channels/1127235720629723176/1293109191912718376/1295048228718514257
